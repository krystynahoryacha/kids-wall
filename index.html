    <p>Bring the <mark>adventure</mark> of climbing into your home. Residential 
    climbing walls let climbers scale the walls in their rec rooms, bedrooms 
    and home gyms. There is a wide range of climbing walls avaliable from 
    toddler-friendly to advanced; from natural rock-realistic to colorful and 
    brigth. Start small with just hand holds on one or two climbing wall panels 
    <b>OR</b> go big and cover one side of basement or indoor basketball court. 
    You can even get really creative and use climbing panels to access a loft.
